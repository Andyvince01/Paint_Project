# üñºÔ∏è UNISA2022-23.Software_Engineering

This project involves the development of a **sophisticated geometric drawing application** that enables users to create and manipulate drawings composed of various geometric shapes. Implemented using the **Scrum process**, the application is designed to provide an intuitive and feature-rich environment for both casual users and advanced graphic designers.

## ‚úèÔ∏è **Application Features**

The primary interface of the application presents an **initially empty window** where users can create drawings by selecting and placing geometric shapes. The supported shapes include **line segments, rectangles,** and **ellipses**. Users have the flexibility to customize the appearance of these shapes by selecting their colors. At least **eight different colors** must be supported, and for closed shapes such as rectangles, users can also choose the fill color of the interior.

## üé® **Shape Manipulation and Editing**

Once shapes are added to the drawing, users can interact with them in various ways. They can **select a shape** with a mouse operation to perform edits such as `deletion`, `movement`, `color changes`, and `resizing`. Additionally, standard operations like `Cut`, `Copy`, and `Paste` are supported for shapes. The application features **unlimited undo functionality**, allowing users to revert any changes made during their session.

Shapes within the drawing can be reordered with commands to send a shape `"to the front"` or `"to the back"`, which is particularly useful in scenarios where shapes overlap. The visibility and layering of overlapping shapes can be managed to achieve the desired visual effect.

## üñ±Ô∏è **Interface and Usability**

The application supports **zooming capabilities** with at least eight different levels, ensuring that users can view their drawings in varying degrees of detail. The drawing surface can extend beyond the visible window, with **scrolling functionality** to navigate to different parts of the drawing. An optional grid can be displayed to assist in the precise positioning of shapes, with customizable grid size and visibility settings.

## üîÑ **Advanced Shape Features**

Beyond basic geometric shapes, users can create **arbitrary polygons** and **text shapes**. For text shapes, users can adjust the character size. The application also allows for advanced transformations including `rotation by any angle`, `mirroring` (horizontally or vertically), and `stretching` (horizontally or vertically).
